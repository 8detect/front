      <h4 class="mdl-color-text--blue-grey-800">What is the Minds Affiliate Program?</h4>
      <p>
        One of our most important missions at Minds is to help our users make money online.  With our Partner Program, we are providing a great opportunity for our users to generate a real income.
      </p>
      <p>
        The policy is simple - users who join our Affiliate Program will earn 25% of the revenue their referrals generate to Minds.
        In other words, if Joe refers Mary to sign up for Minds using his referral link, then Joe will receive 25% of the revenue that Minds generates from Mary’s account.
      </p>
      <p>
        Users who become affiliates can monitor the amount of revenue they are bringing in their wallet, or revenue console.  You can learn more about the revenue console “here”.
      </p>
      <p>
        To learn more about the Affiliate Program, please check out our “Terms and Conditions”

    <div class="m-affiliate--marketing-faq-aq">
      <h4 class="mdl-color-text--blue-grey-800">What is the Revenue Console?</h4>
      <p>
        The revenue console is your way to keep track of how much money you are making through the affiliate program.
        It is located in your wallet, which can be found in the top right of your browser or mobile app.
        In this console, you will see three separate tabs: Payments, Payouts, and Options.
      </p>
      <p>
        Payments - This tab is your way of monitoring all of the purchases that your referrals are transacting on Minds.
        You can see the date of the transaction, the product that was purchased, and how much money you made from that specific transaction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Options - This tab is simply for you to enter your banking information so we are able to make payouts directly to your account.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="m-affiliate--marketing-faq-aq">
      <h4 class="mdl-color-text--blue-grey-800">How do I get paid?</h4>
      <p>
        Once you are set up as a Minds Affiliate, then all you need to do is start referring new users to Minds with your referral link.  For any new user that signs up with your referral link, you will receive 25% of the revenue that Minds receives from that user.
      </p>
      <!--<p>
        Minds generates revenue from users with the following products:
        <ul>
          <li>Points - users can purchase points on Minds and use them to expand their reach and gain more views</li>
          <li>Paid Boost - users can pay Minds directly when they post to get more views</li>
          <li>Priority Boost - users can pay Minds directly when they post to get to the front of the Boost queue</li>
          <li>Minds Plus - users can purchase Minds Plus for added benefits on Minds</li>
        </ul>
      </p>-->
      <p>
        Minds Affiliates will make 25% of all of the revenue that Minds generates from the users they refer.
        However, please note that in some cases such as Wire and P2P Boost, Minds is only taking a 5% fee of the total transaction, so therefore Minds Affiliates only will generate a 1.25% fee from these products.
      </p>
      <p>
        Minds will payout affiliates on a monthly basis.  Please note that Minds Affiliates are agreeing to our “Terms and Conditions” and are subject to some risk such as chargebacks if it is discovered that a referred user transacted with a fraudulent credit card.

    <div class="m-affiliate--marketing-faq-aq">
      <h4 class="mdl-color-text--blue-grey-800">How is my payment calculated?</h4>
      <p>
        In the Revenue console, you will notice a list of payments that are pending for your account.
        On all transactions, Minds will take 75% of the transaction, and Stripe will take 3% of the transaction plus a $0.30 fee for their service.
        Minds Affiliates will be credited the remaining 22%.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="m-affiliate--marketing-faq-aq">
      <h4 class="mdl-color-text--blue-grey-800">Why did my balance go down?</h4>
      <p>
        Chargebacks and/or refunds will be deducted from your balance.
        A chargeback occurs when the customer or their bank disputes a transaction for being fraudulent.
        In the event that a chargeback creates a negative balance, we will seek to reclaim these funds by debiting your bank account.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="m-affiliate--marketing-faq-aq">
      <h4 class="mdl-color-text--blue-grey-800">How frequently are Affiliates paid out?</h4>
      <p>
        Payouts will be issued on a rolling monthly basis.
