        <li>Minds Plus badge on your channel</li>
        <li>Option to request a Verified badge for your channel</li>

      </ul>
    </m-faq>
    <m-faq question="What is a Plus badge?">
      <p>
        By signing up for Plus, users are given a Plus user badge on their channel.
      </p>
    </m-faq>
    <m-faq question="What is Verified badge?">
      <p>
        In many cases, users will also want to verify their identity. Plus provides users with the option to request a Verified badge. Once a request is submitted, the Minds team will review the submission.
      </p>
    </m-faq>
    <m-faq question="What does opting out of ads and boosts do?">
      <p>
        Minds users will notice that there are advertisements and boosted content on the site.
        The purpose of the boost queue is to provide our users with the ability to promote their content and reach new audiences.
        It also provides our users with a way to discover new content they enjoy, outside of who they are subscribed to.
      </p>
      <p>
        With Plus, you are given the option to opt-out of the boost queue and all third party ads so that they do not appear on your feeds.
        While we hope that you continue to use the boost queue to keep a better pulse on the Minds community, we understand that many users only desire to see the content they are subscribed to.
        Plus lets you make this call.
      </p>
    </m-faq>
    <m-faq question="What is exclusive Minds content?">
      <p>
        Plus users will gain access to exclusive Minds content.
      </p>
    </m-faq>
    <m-faq question="How do users receive their 1,000 points a month?">
      <p>
        Each month, Plus users will receive 1,000 points in their wallet.
        This process will be automated and the points will be deposited directly into the userâ€™s wallet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Users may leverage these points to boost their content and earn more views (1 point = 1 view).
        Users may also wire the points directly to other channels they enjoy and would like to support.
      </p>
    </m-faq>
    <m-faq question="What is the cancellation policy?">
      <p>
        You may cancel your Plus subscription at any time.
        Refunds and credits will not be issued for partial billing periods.
      </p>
