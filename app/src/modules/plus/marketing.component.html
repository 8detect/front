      <h4 class="mdl-color-text--blue-grey-800">What is Verified badge?</h4>

      <p>
        Earn revenue with advertisements on your blogs by selecting the '$' sign when you post.
        The amount of revenue you earn will be determined from the number of pageviews your content drives and the current RPM (revenue per thousand views).
        The ad-revenue share is 80% for creators and 20% for Minds.

      <h4 class="mdl-color-text--blue-grey-800">What does opting out of ads and boosts do?</h4>
      <p>
        Minds users will notice that there are advertisements and boosted content on the site.
        The purpose of the boost queue is to provide our users with the ability to promote their content and reach new audiences.
        It also provides our users with a way to discover new content they enjoy, outside of who they are subscribed to.
      </p>
      <p>
        With Plus, you are given the option to opt-out of the boost queue and all third party ads so that they do not appear on your feeds.
        While we hope that you continue to use the boost queue to keep a better pulse on the Minds community, we understand that many users only desire to see the content they are subscribed to.
        Plus lets you make this call.

      <h4 class="mdl-color-text--blue-grey-800">How do users receive their 1,000 points a month?</h4>
      <p>
        Each month, Plus users will receive 1,000 points in their wallet.
        This process will be automated and the points will be deposited directly into the userâ€™s wallet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Users may leverage these points to boost their content and earn more views (1 point = 1 view).
        Users may also wire the points directly to other channels they enjoy and would like to support.
